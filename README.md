An EmulationStation theme manager for small screen devices running [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos), [RetroOZ](https://github.com/southoz/RetroOZ), [TheRA](https://techtoytinker.com/theretroarena), [JELOS](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution),  [UnofficialOS](https://github.com/RetroGFX/UnofficialOS), [NostixOS](https://github.com/NostixOS/Nostix) or [ROCKNIX](https://github.com/ROCKNIX/distribution).

ThemeMaster needs to map the device's D-pad and buttons to keys that can be used with the 'dialog' function which requires a specific implementation for every input driver. Please report for additional support if your input driver is not recognised.
Example of devices currently supported :
- Gameforce Chi
- Powkiddy RGB10, RGB10 Max/3, RGB30, X55 and XU10
- Anbernic RG351P/M/V, RG552, RG503 and RG-ARC
- RK2020
- R36S
- Odroid-go Advance, Super and Ultra units

See the [ThemeMaster's page](https://johnirvine1433.github.io/ThemeMaster/) for more information and installation guide.

Feel free to suggest any enhancement and to report any issue directly through GitHub. Alternatively - and for any questions, comments or feedback - you can find me on the Retro Game Handhelds Discordâ€™s server
