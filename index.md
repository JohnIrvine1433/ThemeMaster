ThemeMaster is an EmulationStation theme manager for small screen devices running [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos), [RetroOZ](https://github.com/southoz/RetroOZ), [TheRA](https://techtoytinker.com/theretroarena), [JELOS](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution), [UnofficialOS](https://github.com/RetroGFX/UnofficialOS), [NostixOS](https://github.com/NostixOS/Nostix) or [ROCKNIX](https://github.com/ROCKNIX/distribution).

ThemeMaster needs to map the device's D-pad and buttons to keys that can be used with the 'dialog' function which requires a specific implementation for every input driver. 
Please report for additional support if your input driver is not recognised. 
Here some few devices being supported :
- Gameforce Chi
- Powkiddy RGB10, RGB10 Max/3, RGB30, X55 and XU10
- Anbernic RG351P/M/V, RG353M, RG552, RG503 and RG-ARC
- RK2020
- R36S
- Odroid-go Advance, Super and Ultra units

## Application Modes
### Theme Gallery mode (default one)
In **Theme Gallery** mode, ThemeMaster relies on information from [Emulationstation-OGA-Theme-Gallery](https://github.com/Jetup13/Emulationstation-OGA-Theme-Gallery) by [Jetup](https://github.com/Jetup13) to create a bespoke theme collection (allowing access from different GitHub accounts at once).
Collection is cached locally and updated at startup whenever new commit exists on [Emulationstation-OGA-Theme-Gallery](https://github.com/Jetup13/Emulationstation-OGA-Theme-Gallery) repository.

### GitHub Repository mode
In **GitHub repository** mode, ThemeMaster creates a live theme’s collection by pulling information from a GitHub account based on repositories starting with "es-theme".
You can change the account to be used from **ThemeMaster Settings** menu.

### Nota Bene
- Theme management is based on GitHub repository's name. Please note that name duplicates between different GitHub accounts is not managed ; this could lead to replacing a theme with another in this scenario.
- Theme's update management is based on latest GitHub commit's date on the associated repository.
- Uninstaller allows removal of stock themes which you may not be able to reinstall via ThemeMaster.

## Configuration file
ThemeMaster's configuration and user's preferences are saved in the `ThemeMaster.cfg` file which is (re)generated with default values and settings whenever missing.
All user's preferences can be set through the application but some configuration changes can only be done by manually editing the configuration file.

### Editing GitHub accounts list
The list of GitHub accounts used in **Repository mode** can be manually amended by editing the `collections` variable.
It is expected that you do not remove the default GitHub accounts, if you do so they will be restored whenever the application is updated.
Any GitHub account manually added to the collection will be kept when updating the application.
Before adding an account, please make sure that repositories are pre-set with the correct ES folder structure as ThemeMaster relies on GitHub source file's structure.

### Dialog UI color schemes
ThemeMaster color schemes are defined in runtime configuration files placed within the `ThemeMaster` folder.
Additional configuration files can be added following the same name pattern : [name].dialogrc 
They must be manually referenced in the `app_colorscheme` variable (without the extension).

### Nota Bene
- Files within the `data` subfolder are automatically (re)generated by the application.
- Prerelease versions may have been barely tested, use at your own risk.

# Credits
ThemeMaster reused some external code to emulated keyboards and to display pictures :
- 'tm-joypad' binary is based on [AnberPorts-Joystick](https://github.com/krishenriksen/AnberPorts-Joystick) by [Kris Henriksen](https://github.com/krishenriksen)
- 'image-viewer' binary is based on [Image Viewer](https://github.com/RICCIARDI-Adrien/Image_Viewer) by [Adrien Ricciardi](https://github.com/RICCIARDI-Adrien)

## Background
Original script [ArkThemes](https://github.com/TadMSTR/ArkThemes) was developed for [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos) by [TadMSTR](https://github.com/TadMSTR) based on [AnberPorts](https://github.com/krishenriksen/AnberPorts) with contributions from **choo t** and **JohnIrvine**.

Most evolutions have been initially implemented on [ArkThemes-fork](https://github.com/JohnIrvine1433/ArkThemes-fork) which has reached EOL following the release of ThemeMaster (new name suggested by **5uck3rpunch**).
